/**
 * Given two nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor (the
 * given two nodes are not guaranteed to be in the binary tree).
 * 
 * Return null If any of the nodes is not in the tree.
 * 
 * Assumptions
 * 
 * There is no parent pointer for the nodes in the binary tree
 * 
 * The given two nodes are not guaranteed to be in the binary tree
 * 
 * Examples
 * 
 * 5
 * 
 * / \
 * 
 * 9 12
 * 
 * / \ \
 * 
 * 2 3 14
 * 
 * The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 14 is 5
 * 
 * The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 9 is 9
 * 
 * The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 8 is null (8 is not in the tree)
