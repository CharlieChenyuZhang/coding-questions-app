/**
 * Given a set of characters represented by a String, return a list containing
 * all subsets of the characters whose size is K. Notice that each subset
 * returned will be sorted for deduplication.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Assumptions
 * 
 * There could be duplicate characters in the original set.
 * 
 * ​
 * 
 * Examples
 * 
 * Set = "abc", K = 2, all the subsets are [“ab”, “ac”, “bc”].
 * 
 * Set = "abb", K = 2, all the subsets are [“ab”, “bb”].
 * 
 * Set = "abab", K = 2, all the subsets are [“aa”, “ab”, “bb”].
 * 
 * Set = "", K = 0, all the subsets are [""].
 * 
 * Set = "", K = 1, all the subsets are [].
 * 
 * Set = null, K = 0, all the subsets are [].
