/**
 * Given an integer k, arrange the sequence of integers [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ....,
 * k - 1, k - 1, k, k], such that the output integer array satisfy this
 * condition:
 * 
 * Between each two i's, they are exactly i integers (for example: between the
 * two 1s, there is one number, between the two 2's there are two numbers).
 * 
 * If there does not exist such sequence, return null.
 * 
 * Assumptions:
 * 
 * k is guaranteed to be > 0 Examples:
 * 
 * k = 3, The output = { 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3 }.
