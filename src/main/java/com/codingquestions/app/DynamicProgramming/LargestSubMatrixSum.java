 * Return the sum of the submatrix.
 * 
 * Assumptions
 * 
 * The given matrix is not null and has size of M * N, where M >= 1 and N >= 1
 * Examples
 * 
 * { {1, -2, -1, 4},
 * 
 * {1, -1, 1, 1},
 * 
 * {0, -1, -1, 1},
 * 
 * {0, 0, 1, 1} }
 * 
 * the largest submatrix sum is (-1) + 4 + 1 + 1 + (-1) + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.
