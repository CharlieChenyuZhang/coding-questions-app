 * Given a rope with positive integer-length n, how to cut the rope into m

 * maximal product of p[0]*p[1]* ... *p[m-1]? m is determined by you and must be
 * greater than 0 (at least one cut must be made). Return the max product you
 * can have.
 * 
 * Assumptions
 * 
 * n >= 2 Examples
 * 
 * n = 12, the max product is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81(cut the rope into 4 pieces with
 * length of each is 3).
