/**
 * Given an array A of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at
 * index 0 of the array. A[i] means the maximum jump distance from index i (you
 * can only jump towards the end of the array). Determine the minimum number of
 * jumps you need to reach the end of array. If you can not reach the end of the
 * array, return -1.
 * 
 * Assumptions
 * 
 * The given array is not null and has length of at least 1. Examples
 * 
 * {3, 3, 1, 0, 4}, the minimum jumps needed is 2 (jump to index 1 then to the
 * end of array)
 * 
 * {2, 1, 1, 0, 2}, you are not able to reach the end of array, return -1 in
 * this case.
